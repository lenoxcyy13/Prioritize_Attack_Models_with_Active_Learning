# Prioritize Attack Models with Active Learning
Previous work in Dr. Yang's group has produced cyber-attack models that reflect unique cyber attack behaviors characterized by attack features, such as attack stages and port-services. While each attack model is unique, their importance varies from one analyst to another depending on the network and feature dependencies. When visualizing the attack models on a 2-dimensional feature space (the bubble plot where each bubble is a model), it will be helpful to rank the feature importance in x and y-axes so that the critical models are shown in the top-right quadrant. This ranking or sorting must take analysts' interpretation on which models are critical. This summer research looks into this problem by applying active learning to learn synthetically generated user interpretation of model criticality and use the learned prediction to sort the attack stage and port-service features to present the models better reflecting users' interpretation of the model criticality.
